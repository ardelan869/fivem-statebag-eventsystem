# fivem-statebag-eventsystem

Uses FiveM's built-in StateBags to route events.

# Description

This is just a fun little project I whipped up in about 10-20 minutes.\
It might be safer than the normal event system, but I do not promise anything.\
Executors like Eulen or RedEngine should still be able to trigger the "StateBag-Events" if the user knows the structure.

# Usage

Add the file `@resourceName/import.lua` into the `shared_scripts` section of your desired `fxmanifest.lua`.\
'@resourceName' refers to the name of the resource; name the resource as you desire, but ensure that the names are consistent.
