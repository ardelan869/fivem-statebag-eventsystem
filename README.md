# fivem-statebag-eventsystem

Uses FiveM's built-in StateBags to route events.

# Description

This is just a fun little project i whipped up in about 10 - 20 minutes.\
It could maybe be safer than the normal event system, but i do not promise anything,\
Executor's like Eulen or RedEngine should still be able to trigger the "StateBag-Events", if the user knows the structure
